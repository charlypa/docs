## worker/WorkerComm

WorkerComm provides util methods to communicate between web workers and Phoenix.
This module can be loaded from within web-workers and a phoenix extension that loads the web-worker.

## Import

### Creating a WebWorker from your extension and attaching `WorkerComm` to it.

See an example extension code below that creates its own web worker and uses `WorkerComm` for communication.

```js
// from within an extension
const WorkerComm = brackets.getModule("worker/WorkerComm"),
      EventDispatcher = brackets.getModule("utils/EventDispatcher"),
      ExtensionUtils = brackets.getModule("utils/ExtensionUtils");

// figure out the path of the web worker relative to your extension
let workerPath = ExtensionUtils.getModulePath(module, "my_worker_path_within_extension.js")

// we need to pass in the `workerCommUrl` so that the web-worker can
// load`WorkerComm` within the worker context as described below.
let workerCommUrl = `${Phoenix.baseURL}worker/WorkerComm.js`;
let eventDispatcherURL = `${Phoenix.baseURL}utils/EventDispatcher.js`;

// load the worker
const _myWorker = new Worker(
`${workerPath}?workerCommUrl=${workerCommUrl}&eventDispatcherURL=${eventDispatcherURL}`);

// Not create a `WorkerComm` object and attach to your extension module exports.
EventDispatcher.makeEventDispatcher(exports);
// all WorkerComm objects needs to be an EventDispatcher.
WorkerComm.createWorkerComm(_myWorker, exports);

// Now `exports` can be used to communicate with the web-worker
// using `WorkerComm` APIs listed below.
```

### Loading `WorkerComm` from within your webWorker

The Web Worker we created above also needs to load `WorkerComm` to be able to communicate with the `WorkerComm`
instance in Phoenix. For this, we need to load `WorkerComm` from the URL parameters.
(WorkerComm.js lib url needs to passed in while creating the web worker from Phoenix).

```js
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
importScripts(urlParams.get('workerCommUrl'));
importScripts(urlParams.get('eventDispatcherURL'));
// After this, a global `WorkerComm` object will be available within the
// web-worker that can be used to communicate with Phoenix.
```

## APIs

## createWorkerComm

Adds support for WorkerComm APIs to the provided web-Worker instance. Only available in the main thread.
This API should be called immediately after creating the worker in main thread.

Type: [function][1]

### Parameters

*   `postTarget` **[string][2]** The web-worker reference.
*   `eventDispatcher` **[object][3]** created with `util/EventDispatcher`.

### Examples

Create a web-worker with `WorkerComm` in an extension.

```javascript
// load the worker [See API docs for full sample]
const _myWorker = new Worker(
`${workerPath}?workerCommUrl=${workerCommUrl}&eventDispatcherURL=${eventDispatcherURL}`);

// Now create a `WorkerComm` object and attach to your extension module exports.
EventDispatcher.makeEventDispatcher(exports);
// all WorkerComm objects needs to be an EventDispatcher.
WorkerComm.createWorkerComm(_myWorker, exports);
```

## setExecHandler

Sets a named function execution handler in the main thread or worker thread.

Type: [function][1]

### Parameters

*   `fnName` **[string][2]** The name of the function to register as exec handler.
*   `execHandlerFn` **[function][1]** 

### Examples

To set a named function `sayHello` in worker and phoenix

```javascript
function sayHello(arg)=>{
    console.log("hello from worker ", arg); // prints "hello from worker phoenix"
    return "Hello Phoenix";
}

// For usage in web-worker say my_worker.js, use the global `WorkerComm` object.
WorkerComm.setExecHandler("sayHello", sayHello);
// For usage in phoenix extension side, use `eventDispatcher` object used with `createWorkerComm`.
YourWorker.setExecHandler("sayHello", sayHello);
```

Returns **[Promise][4]** That will be resolved or rejected based on function execution at the other end.

## execPeer

Executes the named function at the other end if present. If this is called from the main thread, it will
execute the function at the worker thread and vice-versa. The function to execute
is set with API `setExecHandler`.

Type: [function][1]

### Parameters

*   `fnName` **[string][2]** The name of the function to execute at the other end.
*   `paramObject` **[object][3]** to be passed on to the function at the other end.

### Examples

To Execute a named function `sayHello` in the worker from phoenix

```javascript
// in my_worker.js
WorkerComm.setExecHandler("sayHello", (arg)=>{
    console.log("hello from worker ", arg); // prints "hello from worker phoenix"
    return "Hello Phoenix";
  });
// In Phoenix/extension
let workerMessage = await YourWorker.execPeer("sayHello", "phoenix");
console.log(workerMessage); // prints "Hello Phoenix"
```

Returns **[Promise][4]** That will be resolved or rejected based on function execution at the other end.

## triggerPeer

Triggers events at the other end on the eventDispatcher. If this is called from the main thread, it will
trigger `WorkerComm` global at the worker thread. If this is called from the worker thread, it will
trigger `eventDispatcher` used in `createWorkerComm` API call when creating the worker.

Type: [function][1]

### Parameters

*   `eventName` **[string][2]** to trigger at the other end
*   `paramObject` **[object][3]** to be passed on to the event listener at the other end.

### Examples

To Trigger a named event `searchDone` from worker to phoenix

```javascript
// in my_worker.js
WorkerComm.triggerPeer("searchDone", {matches: 2});

// In Phoenix/extension, you can listen to these events
YourWorker.on("searchDone", (result)=>{
    console.log(result.matches);
});
```

## loadScriptInWorker

Loads a script into the worker context. Only available within the main thread. This can be used
by the main Phoenix thread to dynamically load scripts in the worker-thread.

Type: [function][1]

### Parameters

*   `scriptURL` **[string][2]** the Full url to load.

### Examples

To load a script `add_worker_Script.js` into the your worker:

```javascript
WorkerComm.createWorkerComm(_myWorker, exports);
.....
let ExtensionUtils = brackets.getModule("utils/ExtensionUtils");
let addWorkerScriptPath = ExtensionUtils.getModulePath(module, "add_worker_Script.js")
await exports.loadScriptInWorker(addWorkerScriptPath);
```

## EVENT_WORKER_COMM_INIT_COMPLETE

Raised on main thread when WorkerComm is loaded in the web-worker and is ready.
