## worker/ExtensionsWorker

This is a generic web worker that is available for use by extensions to offload extension related tasks. This
should only be used for performing small compute tasks and should not be used for long-running compute tasks.

*   Extensions are advised to use [worker/IndexingWorker][1] if they are performing large number of
    file operations to utilize the file cache.
*   Extensions performing large compute tasks should create their own worker and may use easy util methods in
    [worker/WorkerComm][2] to communicate with the web worker.

## Import

```js
// usage within extensions:
const ExtensionsWorker = brackets.getModule("worker/ExtensionsWorker");
```

## Extending the ExtensionsWorker

You can add your own custom scripts to the ExtensionsWorker by following the below example. Suppose you have an
extension folder with the following structure:

    myExtensionFolder
    │  my_worker.js // the script that you need to attach to the web worker
    │  main.js

In `main.js` extension module, we can import `my_worker.js` script into `ExtensionsWorker` by:

```js
let ExtensionUtils = brackets.getModule("utils/ExtensionUtils");
let workerPath = ExtensionUtils.getModulePath(module, "my_worker.js")
ExtensionsWorker.loadScriptInWorker(workerPath);
```

Once the worker script is loaded with the above step:

*   Phoenix can communicate with worker using the `IndexingWorker` reference in Phoenix.
*   Worker can communicate with Phoenix with the global `WorkerComm` reference within the Indexing worker.

All utility methods in module [worker/WorkerComm][2] can be used for worker communication.

A global constant `Phoenix.baseURL` is available in the worker context to get the base url from which phoenix was
launched.

NB: You can use all util methods available in `worker/WorkerComm` as `ExtensionsWorker` internally uses `WorkerComm`
to communicate with the underlying worker thread.

## WorkerComm-APIS

To communicate between the ExtensionsWorker and Phoenix, the following methods are available:
`loadScriptInWorker`, `execPeer`, `setExecHandler`, `triggerPeer` and other APIs described
in module `worker/WorkerComm`.
The above methods can be used with either `ExtensionsWorker` reference within Phoenix
or the global `WorkerComm` reference within the Indexing worker. (See example below.)

See [worker/WorkerComm][2] for detailed API docs.

### Examples

To Execute a named function `extensionName.sayHello` in the worker from phoenix

```javascript
// in my_worker.js. It is a good practice to prefix your `[extensionName]`
// to exec handler to prevent name collisions with other extensions.
WorkerComm.setExecHandler("extensionName.sayHello", (arg)=>{
    console.log("hello from worker ", arg); // prints "hello from worker phoenix"
    return "Hello Phoenix";
  });
// In Phoenix/extension
let workerMessage = await ExtensionsWorker.execPeer("extensionName.sayHello", "phoenix");
console.log(workerMessage); // prints "Hello Phoenix"
```
